			<h1>How to Choose the Best Project Management Tool If You Are a Millennial?</h1>
			
			<p>The role of project management is becoming more and more relevant no matter in which area or industry it is implemented. 
			In fact, it balances all project processes and steps and helps project teams meet their goals and objectives.</p>
			
			<p>Project management helps to reach goals faster, cheaper and avoid risks thereby contributing greatly to business 
			strategy execution. More companies cannot imagine their performance success without project management as one of the 
			key business competencies. Since this competence is actively developing, professional project management software is 
			also evolving with it in the same way.</p>

			<h2>What project management software to choose?</h2>
			
			<p>Defining the best project management tool for your needs, it's worth to pay attention to the <strong>latest project management 
			trends</strong> that reflect actual business reality. Among all of them, let's outline 5 most important:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>The increasing complexity of projects</strong>. Project managers who may present complex processes to their customers in a 
					simple way will be able to create great strategies for project promotion.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Continuous popularity of Agile methods</strong>. Powerful Agile techniques are gaining stream and becoming standards for 
					many companies in various areas.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Convenient Kanban boards</strong> as one of the most effective way to visualize and track projects. They are increasingly 
					being integrated into more structured project management. Applying Kanban allows project managers to embrace innovations 
					to manage their projects and offers a place to manage tasks, to-do lists, and files.
				
				</li>
				<li>
					The factor of <strong>integration of project management software</strong>. PM tools continue to become simpler to use and more 
					integrated with other services and this trend is actively supported by PM platforms' developers.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The growth of remote teams</strong> and remote project management. Many employers have already recognized a higher 
					degree of teams' satisfaction, reduced logistical and administrative overheads, reduction in sick time, and many more benefits.
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Does an ideal PM software exist? It depends on your requirements. You may identify the best tool for your needs only 
			comparison plenty of them. Here I gather the most useful and powerful set of features that should be useful in modern 
			project management. You will also find some relevant examples of popular platforms. So, these powerful functions are 
			Kanban boards, to-do lists, milestones, prioritization, collaboration, and time tracking feature.</p>
			
			<h2>Kanban boards</h2>
			
			<p>Project workflow describes all procedures that are involved in completing tasks. It's about the defined sequence of 
			project steps required to produce results.</p>
			
			<p>Applying the defined workflow, we can structure projects and get a well-visualized system. The workflow includes 
			actors, activities, results, and state. All these are perfectly managed with the help of smart project management software.</p>
			
			<p>Workflow tools are helpful in tracking tasks and projects as they move through all processes stages. 
			Kanban boards and cards are often used for these aims and 
			
				<a

					class='textlink' 
					target='_blank'
					>
				Hygger
				</a>
			
			is one of the best Kanban board tools for project managers.</p>
			
			<p>In Hygger, users may easily create and manage convenient boards for any kind of process. The platform proposes 
			a great set of functionality at the card level (commenting, file attachments, assigning collaborators, etc.). 
			The most typical columns that users apply are To do, In Progress and Done. However, you are free to name them as you wish.</p>
			
			<img 
				src='./pic/1c9a9defca17d7883950477a55dd7bc9.jpg' 
				alt='hygger interface' 
				title='pic #4' 
				class='rightpicture'
				/>
			
			<p>If you need to limit the number of current tasks, you may use Work in progress limits option available 
			in Hygger and also apply horizontal columns, Swimlanes. It seems appropriate for Millenials as, being always 
			in multitasks reality, they may clearly maintain a product backlog and use one of the built-in prioritization 
			frameworks that help to prioritize and order ideas and tasks easily.</p>
			
			<p>These and other great feature make the platform really competitive and helpful.</p>
			
			<h2>To-do lists</h2>
			
			<p>The value of to do lists should not be depreciated even if today we have many substitutions and innovative 
			alternative options. To do lists is an extremely powerful feature that many project management tools offer.</p>
			
			<p>They are one of the oldest and easiest ways of organizing the day or the project ahead. Project managers know 
			how to do lists can do wonders and influence on productivity. They are helpful in setting goals, planning project 
			deliverables, project steps scheduling, etc.</p>
			
			<p>The function of listing and organizing information is well presented in 
			
				<a href='https://asana.com/' class='textlink' target='_blank'>Asana</a>. 
			
			The platform allows creating and managing tasks as well as sharing to-do lists with your team members.</p>
			
			<p>Every to-do list looks like a separate project with tasks listed underneath the project hierarchy. 
			It's possible to create sub-tasks here and define each task with a category tag for easy searching. 
			Attaching files is also available. Moreover, the tool allows quick switching between to do lists, Kanban boards, 
			and calendars for the same projects.</p>

				title='pic #5' 
				class='leftpicture'
				/>
			
			<h2>Roadmap and milestones</h2>
			
			<p>Project milestones are used to delineate important points in a project schedule. These points visualize the 
			start and finish of projects and mark the completion of a major phase of work.</p>
			
			<p>Actually, milestones can be used to note anything that has started or finished. 
			They primarily used as a scheduling tool.</p>
			
			<p>For managing project milestones, you need a powerful roadmap that is often visualized 
			with the help of convenient Gantt diagrams.</p>
			
			<p>These horizontal bars illustrate project completion dates, progress, milestones, and dependencies. 
			While Kanban boards are best used at the task level, Gantt diagrams are better suited for managing at a zoomed-out level.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				<a href='https://www.wrike.com/' class='textlink' target='_blank'>Wrike</a>
			
			has powerful Gantt functionality and balances advanced project management features with an easy-to-use user interface. 
			The tool allows project teams to assign work and collaborate over their projects, tracking time and project assets.</p>
			
			<p>This platform is built with software development teams in mind and lets them extend the tool’s capabilities in custom ways.</p>

			<h2>Prioritization</h2>
			
			<p>Prioritizing project work may be a real challenge for project teams from various industries. 
			When you do not prioritize work, you can damage all your team’s efforts and initiatives, and even drain team motivation.</p>
			
			<p>Effective prioritization is like an art that's why more PM software pays attention to this crucial function.</p>
			
			<p>If your product backlog needs global «cleaning» and optimization, you’ll definitely need powerful 
			prioritization methodologies and frameworks to get things done quickly.</p>
			
			<p>One of the tools that propose a functional prioritization matrix is 
			
				<a href='https://www.productboard.com/' class='textlink' target='_blank'>ProductBoard</a>.
			
			This matrix lets users visualize the value/effort (value/complexity) tradeoff across all features.</p>
			
			<img 
				src='./pic/8997ced5c952db0995888cb01ea1f7a5.jpg' 
				alt='prioritization matrix' 
				title='pic #7' 
				class='leftpicture'
				/>
			
			<p>You may also find a great set of prioritization techniques in Hygger.io (Eisenhower matrix, Value vs Risk, 
			Value vs Effort, ICE and RICE frameworks and the Weighted scoring model).</p>
			
			<img 
				src='./pic/8fad27dc6fea03c92c6bd91672e6a051.jpg' 
				alt='prioritization type' 
				title='pic #8' 
				class='rightpicture'
				/>
			
			<h2>Collaboration</h2>
			
			<p>Team collaboration has always been an important part of any business and now it is becoming more critical 
			as we continue to be more interconnected via online technologies. Improving team collaboration is a permanent 
			goal for all types of companies.</p>
			
			<p>Project management tools care about making their collaborating functionality throughout the world an easy process. 
			Some of the famous project management tools have initially focused on team collaboration.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				<a href='https://basecamp.com/' class='textlink' target='_blank'>Basecamp</a>
			
			is a vivid example. Basecamp message boards, native chats, and file sharing make the platform 
			an excellent solution for collaboration with team members and customers.</p>
			
			<p>The system combines communication, project management, digital asset management and basic 
			payment options all in one place.</p>
			
			<img 
				src='./pic/11f43be071c05b01d25d3e992442be23.jpg' 
				alt='collaboration functionality' 
				title='pic #9' 
				class='leftpicture'
				/>
			
			<h2>Time tracking</h2>
			
			<p>During a project course, various modifications to the activities and resources may happen. 
			Tracking of time spent on different activities is crucial in many ways.</p>
			
			<p>For project managers, it is important to understand and track the hours the resource is putting 
			on different activities. The proper time entry allows project managers to see that the time is not exceeding 
			the estimated time, and mitigate potential risks in advance. That's why this feature seems like the obvious 
			one when choosing an appropriate PM software.</p>
			
			<p>

			can be considered as a good example. it helps project managers to get the best out of their team. 
			The system allows gaining an in-depth insight into the workings of the teams and the progress of their projects. 
			Here you'll find complex, but informative reports and data outputs.</p>
			
			<p>The time tracking feature helps to track team productivity, increase efficiency and minimize time waste. 
			The platform also includes accounting features that allow tracking employee expenses, set budgets, and receive payments.</p>
